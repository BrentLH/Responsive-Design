                <h3>Wildflowers and Plant Life</h3>
                <p>Indian Mound Reserve has one of the most
                    spectacular wildflower displays in early May.
                    Approximately 100 species of wildflowers are in the
                    park, some of which are rare, including snow trillium.
                    The gorge is an ideal habitat for these wildflowers
                    because they are protected from the weather and
                    foraging animals. Additionally, they thrive in the
                    moist air and chemical structure of the rocks in the
                    gorge.</p>
                <p>Indian Mound Reserve has one of the largest
                    groves of white arborvitae, a tree on Ohio’s protected
                    species list. This tree is unique in that it grows out of
                    the limestone that lines the walls of the gorge.

                <h3>The Gorge and Wetlands</h3>
            </p>
            <p>Massie Creek Gorge was created by the Wisconsin
                Glacier, which retreated from Southwest Ohio
                12,000 years ago. The glacier left its mark on the
                land as melting ice eroded deep river valleys and cut
                through sedimentary rocks formed more than 425
                million years ago.</p>
            <p>The depth of the gorge, the coolness of the creek and
                the beauty of the white cedars, ferns, and wildflowers that flourish in the moistness make Massie Creek
                Gorge one of the area’s most spectacular sites.</p>
            <p>Another significant characteristic of the park is the
                wetland area, which can be seen on the way to the
                Pollock Works. Although wetlands once covered
                much of Ohio, they were considered to be useless,
                drained and filled. Today, wetlands are protected
                because they provide a habitat for numerous plants
                and animals, along with acting as a natural water
                purification system.

                <h3>The Waterfall and Mills</h3>
                <p>Cedar Cliff Falls, one of the most noteworthy sites
                    at Indian Mound Reserve, is a dam built to harness power for the Harbison Mill, which operated
                    until approximately 1917. The dam is a stone arch
                    design and was originally 40 feet tall. The arch faces
                    upstream using water pressure to force the stones
                    together. After the mill was closed, several stone
                    layers at the top were removed to eliminate flow into
                    the mill race.</p>
                <p>Another mill that utilized the power of the dam
                    was the Hager Straw Board and Paper Company,
                    which operated into the late 1930’s. It had the most
                    significant impact on the Indian Mound Reserve due
                    to the large amounts of toxic effluent produced by
                    the paper milling process.</p>
                <p>An elaborate system of piping, sluiceway and
                    ditches were constructed to carry the effluents to
                    settling ponds downstream. The observant hiker will
                    spot sections of the round clay tiles that made up
                    the sluiceway along the Cedar Cliff Trail. Settling
                    ponds were created to contain the toxic effluent from
                    the paper company. Although no longer in use, the
                    concrete structures that controlled the flow to these
                    ponds can be seen on the north side of the levee.
